#Project plan for editing the Shakespeare Data

= Introduction =

The form needs to load the data from the triple store for a given entity or event, allow the user to edit the data and save it back to the triple store as their interpretation of the entity/event


= Details =

== Milestone 1: Basic Entity Editor {COMPLETED} ==

 * Editor gets character and location information from the automatically generated in the data store and presents this to the user. 
 * User can edit the character name/location name strings
 * User can save this information back to the data store as their version of the character/location

Notes: Have to work out about identification/authorisation. Can anyone write? Use names? Hashed email addresses? Can link in with site log in?

Progress So Far (Keith): Implemented login with OpenID (& Google's flavour), user able to edit character names. Data put back into fourstore in a graph identified by a SHA1 hash of the returned OpenID. Still a few wrinkles to work out with fourstore-php.

COMPLETED - Entity and Location editors now work and save to graph specified by the open log in ID

BONUS - Event and Entity information display also working


== Milestone 2: Enhanced Entity Editor ==

 * User can assert that two entities are the same 
 * User can assert basic geographic links between locations (next to, within etc)? 

Progress so far (Keith): Implemented functions to add triples from properties and dropdown/text options

(Faith): Duplicated code implemented on characteredit page on locationedit page and added way to differentiate between which groups of properties are displayed as options.

To Do: 
 # Implement addition of reciprocal values
 # Multiple dropdowns (in javascript add create and add properties to multiple dropdown boxes - still creating options on a per-page basis but can have multiple options within that page)
 # Entity drop downs and text boxes implemented - also need to implement classes dropdown
 # Improve display

== Milestone 3: Basic Event Editor ==

 * Editor can load up the information related to an event:
  ** Event Type (drop down of allowed event types)
  ** Location (drop down of known locations)
  ** Subject Entity (checky boxes of known characters - if more than one is selected then a group should be made/used)
  ** Subjects Involved (checky boxes of known characters - if more then one is selected then a group should be made/used. This list should include any subject entities even if they are not checked)
  ** References (Checky boxes of all known characters and locations)
  ** Event specific information
   ** In the case of travel events then:
    ** From (drop down of known locations)
    ** To (drop down of known locations)
 * User can edit the event details
 * User can save this information back to the data store as their version of the character/location

== Milestone 4: Extended Entity Editor ==

 * User can create new character and location entities

== Milestone 5: Extended Event Editor == 

 * User can create and populate new events
 * User can select from more types of events

== Milestone 6: Bonus Options ==

 * User can delete events
 * User can delete character and location entities

== Milestone 7: Social Stuff ==

 * User profile page (save foaf data for annotator)

== Milestone 8: Bloody Statistics == 

 * Page showing fun and interesting statistics drawn from the graph
  ** Number of editors
  ** Most corrected
  ** Most contentious
  ** etc
